          Hi, I'm Akio, software engineer and tech lead based in Pampanga, Philippines. I have more than 4 years of
          relevant experience in defining requirements, designing, delivering, and maintaining complex web applications.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          I taught myself coding in 2013, a year after that I joined a Manila-based startup as one of its pioneering engineers.
          I make fullstack web applications and scripts, and I also have some experience making mobile applications for iOS systems.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          I specialize in PHP, JS, and SQL. I also have professional experience working with Laravel, VueJS, NuxtJS, Python, and Google Cloud Platform.
          In my spare time, I enjoy reading books, watching videos about science and history, learning about new web technologies
          and dipping my toes in Deep Learning.
        </p>

          I currently work as CTO at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hiraya_manila/">@hiraya_manila</a>.
